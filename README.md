## How it works
### Connections
All you have to do it lauch the application, attached your computer to a live video switcher (e.g. via HDMI/Mini Display) and set the display window to full screen on your output window.

### Google Sheets
Grab the ID from whatever Google Sheet you want to pull info from (you can use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPsvb5-kmFa4rSAH89j0B1Bb4DFLfK8_QlhVvwthyAU/edit?usp=sharing) as a template).
If you'd rather not use Google Sheets, just enter the information right into Live Stream Break!

## Features

### Update content
You can either make changes on your Google Sheet, or adjust any details on the fly through Live Stream Break - they'll both work.

### Grab data from a spreadsheet
Set up your scedule using a Google Sheet so that you don't have to do lots of copy/pasting during the live event.

### Timers

What 'Talk Time' will begin a countdown timer right on your Live Stream Break display window, this will allow viewers to be kept up to date.

There are also desktop notifcations built right in so that you know when there are 5 mins, 3 mins & 1 minute left on the timer.

### On-brand
(Coming soon) You'll be able to change the branding of LSB.
